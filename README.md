# Virtual Immersive Behavioral Sciences (VIBES) Lab

## Overview

This project is a collaborative research initiative between the Psychology, Neuroscience, and Computer Science departments at Baldwin Wallace University. Our goal is to develop realistic 3D environments using the Unity Engine to study fear conditioning and fear extinction in a controlled virtual setting. By leveraging VR technology, we aim to provide new insights into how fear responses can be triggered and diminished over time.

## Features

- Realistic 3D Environments: Built using Unity with assets from the Unity Asset Store.

- Eye & Camera Tracking: Utilizes the HTC VIVE Pro Eye to gather precise tracking data.

- SimpleOmnia Integration: Developed by Justin Kasowski, SimpleOmnia accelerates development and enhances our ability to collect eye-tracking and camera-tracking data efficiently.

- Fear Conditioning & Extinction Models: Designed to simulate real-world scenarios that induce and measure fear responses.

- Developed Python scripts to map and analyze eye-tracking data for visual behavior insights
